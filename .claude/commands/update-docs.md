You are tasked with updating all project documentation after code changes on this branch.

## Context Analysis
First, analyze what has changed:
1. Review all git diff changes on the current branch compared to main/master
2. Identify the scope and nature of changes (new features, API changes, configuration updates, etc.)
3. Understand the impact on existing functionality

## Documentation Review & Update
Next, comprehensively review and update all documentation:

1. **Find all documentation files**: Locate all `.md`, `.mdx`, and documentation files in the project
2. **Review each file** for relevance to the changes made
3. **Update documentation** where needed, focusing on:
    - API documentation for any changed endpoints/functions
    - Configuration guides for new/modified settings
    - Installation/setup instructions if dependencies changed
    - Examples and code snippets that may be outdated
    - README files and getting started guides
    - Changelog or release notes

## Documentation Standards
When updating documentation, prioritize:
- **Simplicity**: Use clear, straightforward language
- **Conciseness**: Remove unnecessary words while maintaining clarity
- **Clarity**: Ensure examples are practical and easy to follow
- **Consistency**: Match existing documentation style and formatting
- **Accuracy**: Verify all code examples and instructions work

## Specific Tasks
- Add documentation for any new features or APIs
- Remove or update documentation for deprecated/changed functionality
- Update code examples to reflect current syntax/usage
- Ensure all links and references are still valid
- Update version numbers or compatibility information if applicable

## Output
For each file you modify:
1. Explain what changes were made and why
2. Ensure the documentation accurately reflects the current codebase
3. Test that any code examples or instructions actually work

Focus on making the documentation as helpful as possible for both new users and existing developers working with the updated code.
